# Solarized Theme

Dark and light custom UI themes for Sublime Text 2.  This theme is forked 
from the already quite excellent [Soda theme](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme) 
and adjusted for the [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color scheme.

Note: This is still work in progress.

## Installation

If you are a git user, the best way to install the theme and keep up to date is to clone the repo directly into your `Packages` directory in the Sublime Text 2 application settings area.

### Using Git

Go to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory and clone the theme repository using the command below:

    git clone https://github.com/frank-oc/solarized-theme/ "Theme - Solarized"

### Download Manually

* Download the files using the GitHub .zip download option
* Unzip the files and rename the folder to `Theme - Solarized`
* Copy the folder to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory

## Activating the theme

To configure Sublime Text 2 to use the theme:

* Open your Sublime Text 2 User Global Preferences file `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Global Settings - User`
* Add (or update) your theme entry to be `"theme": "Solarized Light.sublime-theme"` or `"theme": "Solarized Dark.sublime-theme"`

### Example User Global Settings

    {
        "theme": "Solarized Light.sublime-theme"
    }

## Release Notes

Solarized theme is designed to work with the latest [development build](http://www.sublimetext.com/dev) of Sublime Text 2. ST2 dev builds move quickly and changes can occur with the theme API between releases, so there may be occassions where the theme doesn't quite work with a brand new dev release.

## Legals

The theme contains some icons from the excellent [Pictos](http://pictos.drewwilson.com/) series by Drew Wilson which I have a license for. Any use of these icons, other than for the purpose of the theme itself, would need to comply with Drew's [icon licensing agreement](http://stockart.drewwilson.com/license/).
